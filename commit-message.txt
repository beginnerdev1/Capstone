feat(admin): activity logs (view+JSON+CSV+confirm) + login/logout logging

Admin highlights:
- Routes: add admin/logs, admin/getLogs, admin/exportLogs
- Controller: implement Admin::logs(), Admin::getLogs() with filters (date, action, method, q), and Admin::exportLogs() with CSV streaming
- View: new app/Views/admin/logs.php with filter UI, refresh, and CSV export confirmation modal showing a human-readable summary
- UI: add Activity Logs link to Admin sidebar (AJAX layout)
- Auth: in AdminAuth, create a login log and persist its id in session; on logout update logged_out_at
- Filter: register ActivityLogger and apply after-response to admin/* and superadmin/*; logs non-GET actions and masks password fields
