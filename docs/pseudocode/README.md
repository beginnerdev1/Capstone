Pseudocode for Capstone

This folder contains high-level pseudocode describing key subsystems in the project. Files:

- `overview_pseudo.md` — high-level request routing and error handling
- `users_pseudo.md` — add/update/get/filter flows and server-side validation
- `payments_pseudo.md` — gateway session creation, supersede/reject logic, confirm manual payments, failed-transactions selection
- `admin_ui_pseudo.md` — client-side polling, AJAX flows, sanitizers and form handling
- `cli_remediation_pseudo.md` — interactive CLI tool pseudocode for remediating missed DB updates

How to use
- These files are human-readable planning artifacts intended to guide implementation or review.
- If you want, I can convert them into sequence diagrams, unit-test skeletons, or actual code stubs for controllers/models.
